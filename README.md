The Open Key Project is a library of 3D patterns for keys and security devices.

The concept of restricted access keys provides users with a false sense of security. By making patterns for keys and security bypass techniques publically available it will make users more aware of techniques attackers may be using against them.

Where keys have been created by someone else every attempt to provide a credit in the source  will be given. 

If you would like to add patterns to the project please create a pull request or email a request to samsiphone@live.com
